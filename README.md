# American Baby Names

**Welcome to the American Baby Names analysis using SQL!**

In this project, we'll be exploring how American baby name tastes have evolved over the past century. By analyzing data from the U.S. Social Security Administration, we'll discover which names have stood the test of time and which ones were just a passing trend using SQL.

We have compiled a database of baby names given to over 5,000 American babies in a given year, from 1920 to 2020. Our goal is to understand how popular each name has been over time, and what type of popularity it enjoyed - classic, semi-classic, semi-trendy, or trendy.

We've also created a ranking of the top female names since 1920, so if you have a little girl on the way, you might find some inspiration here. And if you're looking for a specific type of name, like one that ends in "lyn", we've got you covered.

So why did we do this project? Well, we think it's important to know what names are popular, so that you can avoid giving your child a name that everyone else has. Because, let's face it, nobody wants to be one of five "Emily"s in their class.

But on a serious note, we hope this project will help you make an informed decision when it comes to choosing a name for your little one. So take a look at our database, explore the trends, and who knows - you might just find the perfect name for your new bundle of joy!
